# Visualization task

The following plot was produced in my Physics Laboratory course in the third year of my undergraduate degree. It shows the results of the Franck-Hertz experiment I carried out with my lab mates Francesco Dilda and Stefano Boggio Tomasaz. The `matlab` code and the data used to create these plots can be found in this folder.

The original plot was improved in the following ways:

- The labels are now bigger and easier to read.
- The experimental datapoints are bigger.
- The color palette is now colorblind friendly.
